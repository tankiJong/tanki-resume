* This is a product of a startup company. As the core member, I designed a cross platform solution for embed devices. 
* In this platform, the whole program implemented in Node.js, and the core part of the hardware is the router, which running an embed operating system. So I designed a cross compiling solution to compile Node.js to such OS.
* The Peripheral equipment communicate with the router through WIFI. I designed a data transfer protocol for the message transmission.
* Mobile Android application is also developed. The application can control various embed equipment through network.
